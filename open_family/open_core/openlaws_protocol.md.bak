# OpenLaws Protocol — Ethics & QC

All labs preregister thresholds (ΔCCI≥0.03, Δhazard≤−0.01) and include humility statements.

## Core Principles

1. **Preregistration**: All study parameters, hypotheses, and validation thresholds must be declared before data collection
2. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic seeds and version-controlled configuration files
3. **Epistemic Humility**: Use language that suggests, supports, or indicates rather than proves or confirms
4. **Integrity**: SHA256 hashing of all outputs with manifest tracking

## Validation Thresholds

- ΔCCI ≥ 0.03 (minimum improvement in Collective Consciousness Index)
- Δhazard ≤ -0.01 (maximum reduction in hazard/risk)
- OpenLawsScore ≥ 0.75 (composite quality metric)

## Classification Tags

- **VALIDATED**: Meets all thresholds with bootstrap CI support
- **PARTIAL**: Meets some thresholds; requires additional investigation
- **UNDER_REVIEW**: Below thresholds; hypothesis-generation phase
- **HYPOTHESIS-GEN**: Exploratory results; not yet ready for claims
