### **Step 3: Guardian v4 Narrative Validation** ⚠️ **REVISION RECOMMENDED**
**Command:** `python3 qc/guardian_v4/guardian_v4.py --validate --file open_data/synthesis_narrative.md --report`

**Guardian v4 Score:** 61.4 / 100 (Target: ≥90 for publication)  
**Risk Level:** HIGH (orange)  
**Classification:** FAIL (below 70/100 threshold)

#### Component Scores:
| Metric | Score | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Objectivity | 0.60 | 0.80 | ⚠️ BELOW |
| Transparency v2 | 0.15 | 0.90 | ⚠️ BELOW |
| Language Safety | 1.00 | 0.85 | ✅ PASS |
| Sentiment Neutrality | 0.32 | [-0.1, 0.1] | ⚠️ OUTSIDE |

#### Guardian Recommendations:
1. **Objectivity (0.60 → 0.80):** Add more hedging terms ("suggests", "may indicate", "appears to") and reduce confident assertions
2. **Transparency (0.15 → 0.90):** Add explicit citations, study IDs, seed values, data availability statements, and methodology references
3. **Sentiment (0.32 → neutral):** Reduce positive framing ("improve", "enhance", "prioritizing") and use more neutral scientific language

**Status:** Narrative content generated; requires Guardian-guided revision for publication (Phase 5)

**Primary:** Collaborative learning environments increase CCI in educational systems  
**Testable Predictions:** 4 statistical tests

### Hypothesis 3: General Social Survey (Social Capital)
**Theme:** trust, social_capital, civic_engagement  
**Primary:** Declining trust trends correlate with reduced community resilience  
**Testable Predictions:** 4 statistical tests

### Hypothesis 4: European Social Survey (Well-being & Trust)
**Theme:** well-being, trust, social_attitudes  
**Primary:** Cross-national trust variations predict differential shock responses  
**Testable Predictions:** 4 statistical tests

### Hypothesis 5: Cooperative Learning Meta-Analysis
**Theme:** collaboration, education, peer_learning  
**Primary:** Cooperative structures amplify learning resilience under academic stress  
**Testable Predictions:** 4 statistical tests

**Total Predictions:** 20 testable relationships  
**Statistical Methods:** Pearson correlation, linear regression, bootstrap CI (n=1000)

## 🔬 Technical Achievements

### OriginChain Integration: SUCCESS
- ✅ Merged 3 validation pipelines (Guardian, TruthLens, MeaningForge)
- ✅ Combined technical (YAML) and narrative (MD) validation approaches
- ✅ Automated hypothesis generation from preregistered datasets
- ✅ Narrative synthesis with ethical considerations

### Hypothesis Quality: HIGH
- ✅ All 5 hypotheses testable with standardized data
- ✅ Statistical methods prespecified (Pearson r, linear regression, bootstrap CI)
- ✅ Ethical considerations documented (privacy, transparency, limitations)
- ✅ Expected impact statements for policy relevance

### Narrative Generation: FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ Markdown output suitable for Guardian v4 validation
- ✅ Epistemic humility language ("suggests", "may indicate")
- ✅ Methodology transparency (formulas, sample sizes, tests)
- ⚠️ Guardian score indicates revision needed for publication standards

## 📊 Guardian v4 Analysis — Detailed Findings

### What Worked:
- ✅ **Language Safety: 1.00** — No harmful, biased, or inflammatory language
- ✅ Epistemic humility present ("suggests", "appears to")
- ✅ Limitations documented
- ✅ Ethical considerations addressed

### What Needs Improvement:
1. **Objectivity (0.60 vs 0.80 target):**
   - Add more hedging throughout
   - Reduce confident assertions
   - Qualify all predictions with uncertainty language

2. **Transparency (0.15 vs 0.90 target):**
   - Add explicit study_id citations
   - Include seed values in methodology
   - Add DOIs for datasets (when available)
   - Include data availability statements
   - Reference SHA256 hashes explicitly

3. **Sentiment Neutrality (0.32 vs [-0.1, 0.1]):**
   - Reduce positive framing words ("improve", "enhance", "prioritizing")
   - Use neutral descriptors ("change", "relationship", "association")
   - Avoid policy advocacy language

## 🔮 Recommended Narrative Revisions (for Phase 5)

### Revision Strategy:
1. **Add Transparency Elements:**
   ```markdown
   **Data Sources:**
   - WVS Wave 7 (study_id: wvs_trust_wellbeing_wave7, SHA256: 61e6ee8a...)
   - Seeds: [11, 17, 23, 29]
   - Preregistration: open_data/preregister.yml (2025-10-14)
   ```

2. **Enhance Objectivity:**
   - Change: "Trust levels predict..." → "Trust levels may be associated with..."
   - Change: "will improve" → "might be associated with changes in"
   - Change: "suggests that X" → "provides preliminary evidence consistent with X"

3. **Neutralize Sentiment:**
   - Change: "improve resilience" → "alter resilience outcomes"
   - Change: "prioritizing trust-building" → "examining trust-related interventions"
   - Change: "enhance CCI" → "modify CCI values"

### Expected Guardian Score After Revision:
- Objectivity: 0.60 → 0.82 (+0.22)
- Transparency: 0.15 → 0.92 (+0.77)
- Sentiment: 0.32 → 0.05 (-0.27)
- **Projected Total:** 61.4 → 92.1 ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps: Phase 5 Preparation

### Phase 5: Dashboard & Publication (Weeks 12-14)

**Required Before Phase 5:**
1. ✅ Revise synthesis_narrative.md based on Guardian recommendations
2. ✅ Re-validate with Guardian v4 (target: ≥90/100)
3. ✅ Generate replication packet (all data + code + SHA256)
4. ✅ Prepare dashboard integration (Aletheia sync)

**Phase 5 Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Guardian v4 re-validation (after narrative revision)
python3 qc/guardian_v4/guardian_v4.py --validate --file open_data/synthesis_narrative_v2.md --report

# 2. Aletheia dashboard integration
python3 aletheia_sync.py --update-dashboard

# 3. Replication packet generation
python3 tools/gen_replication_packet.py

# 4. Final corpus validation
python3 qc/guardian_v4/guardian_v4.py --validate --corpus --report
```
