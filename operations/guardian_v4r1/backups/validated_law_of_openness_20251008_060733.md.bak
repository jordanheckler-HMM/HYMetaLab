# The Law of Openness — Validated Dataset (20251008_060733)

**Dataset:** discovery_results/mc_phase5_revalidation_20251008_060339/data/runs_summary.csv
**Mean CCI:** 0.787 **Mean Survival:** 0.968  
**Collapse Risk Mean:** 0.605  
**Hazard Mean:** 0.266

### Summary
Across preregistered cross-domain simulations, increasing openness (ε) consistently raised both coherence (CCI) and survival rate.  
The validated regime (ε ≥ ε★≈0.009) exhibits CCI ≥ 0.70 and survival ≥ 0.80 with reproducible bootstrapped CIs (p < 0.05).

### Constants & Parameters
λ★ = 0.90 β/α = 6.49 Agents = [100–500] Epochs = 20 000 – 25 000  
Shock set = [0.1 – 0.5] Domains = bio | synthetic | cosmic

### Interpretation
> Systems with higher openness maintain internal coherence and survival probability despite increasing shocks,  
> suggesting a universal law of adaptive resilience across domains.
