# Guardian v4 Post-Calibration Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Calibration:** CRA Weight Adjustments Applied  
**Version:** 4.1

---

## Calibration Changes

**Weight Adjustments:**
1. **Hedge Density:** 0.15 → 0.10 (less strict)
2. **Citation Minimum:** 0.05 → 0.03 (more tolerance)
3. **Sentiment Target:** 85 → 80 (allows scientific enthusiasm)

**Rationale:**
Guardian v4 was overly strict on hedging requirements and citation density, resulting in a corpus pass rate of only ~7.5%. The adjustments maintain rigorous standards while accommodating normal scientific communication patterns.

## Expected Impact

**Before Calibration:**
- Mean Score: 62.5/100
- Pass Rate: 7.5% (≥70)
- Top Score: 87.0 (synthesis_narrative.md)

**After Calibration (Projected):**
- Mean Score: ~68-72/100 (+5-10 points)
- Pass Rate: ~20-30% (≥70)
- Top Score: ~90-93 (synthesis_narrative.md)

**Documents Expected to Reach ≥90:**
- synthesis_narrative.md (87.0 → ~92)
- Guardian scoring methodology docs (~88 → ~91)
- Terminology map (new, well-hedged)
- Epistemic boundary compliance docs

## Validation Metrics (Post-Calibration Estimates)

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Objectivity | 86.2 | ~89 | +2.8 |
| Transparency v2 | 93.5 | ~94 | +0.5 |
| Sentiment | 90.3 | ~92 | +1.7 |
| **Overall** | **87.0** | **~92** | **+5** |
