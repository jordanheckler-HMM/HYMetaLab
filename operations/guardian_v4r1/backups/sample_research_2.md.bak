# Cognitive Load and Decision Quality

## Introduction

Studies show that cognitive load affects decision quality (Anderson 2021). The data indicates strong negative correlation (r=-0.58, p<0.01) as shown in Table 1.

## Experimental Design

Research demonstrates that task complexity may increases cognitive load (Miller et al. 2020, doi.org/10.5678/cognitive). Evidence suggests that training may reduces this effect (Thompson 2019, Figure 2).

## Findings

Analysis reveals significant interaction effects (Chen & Liu 2022). Results indicate that expertise moderates the relationship (n=150, Î²=0.42, p<0.001) per https://example.com/expertise-study.

The findings show clear patterns across conditions (Peterson 2021, arxiv.org/abs/2104.56789). Data supports the theoretical framework (Kumar et al. 2020).
