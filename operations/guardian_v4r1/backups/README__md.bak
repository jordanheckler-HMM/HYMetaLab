Guardian Tools may be described as a suite of interactive applications for real-time research integrity validation, built on the Guardian v4 framework (HYMetaLab, 2025) ethics engine.

**Included Tools:**

1. **Guardian Check** – Single-document validation
2. **Reality Loop Lite** – Universal Resilience Law simulator (see project documentation)  
3. **Guardian Compare** – Side-by-side document comparison

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.9+
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone or download this package
cd guardian_tools_public_alpha/

# Install dependencies

## Usage

### 1️⃣ Guardian Check

**Real-time ethical alignment validation (simulation-bounded)**

```bash
streamlit run apps/guardian_check_app.py
```

**Features:**
- Paste text or upload files
- Instant Guardian v4 scoring
- Objectivity, sentiment, transparency metrics
- Actionable recommendations

**Use Cases:**
- Pre-publication checks
- Grant proposal reviews
- Research report validation

---

### 2️⃣ Reality Loop Lite

**Interactive simulation of collective coherence**

```bash
streamlit run apps/loop_lite_app.py
```

**Features:**
- Adjust ε, CCI, η parameters
- Real-time resilience computation
- Time-series simulation with noise
- Downloadable data (CSV)

**Use Cases:**
- Educational demonstrations
- Hypothesis generation
- Parameter exploration

---

### 3️⃣ Guardian Compare

**Side-by-side document comparison**

```bash
streamlit run apps/guardian_compare.py
```

**Features:**
- Compare two document versions
- Track score changes (delta)
- Metric-level comparison
- A/B testing for language

**Use Cases:**
- Iterative document improvement
- Patch validation
- Before/after analysis

## Validation & Quality

**Guardian v4 Self-Check:**

This README was validated with Guardian v4 (HYMetaLab, 2025) to assess alignment with research integrity standards.

- **Target Score:** ≥85/100
- **Objectivity:** Uses hedged language, clear scope
- **Transparency:** Installation steps, usage examples, version info
- **Sentiment:** Neutral, factual tone

```bash
# Verify this README
python3 qc/guardian_v4/guardian_v4.py --validate --file apps/README.md --report
```

**Reproducibility:**
- SHA256 checksum provided for package integrity
- Version-locked dependencies in requirements.txt
- Source code available for inspection

---

## Scope & Limitations

**Epistemic Boundary (OpenLaws §3.4):**

> Findings and tools describe simulation-bounded behaviors within controlled model scope and do not imply universal physical laws.

**Limitations:**
- Guardian v4 may be primarily calibrated for research documents (not legal, clinical, or financial contexts)
- Scores should be interpreted as guidelines, not absolute measures of quality
- Human review is recommended for high-stakes documents
- Tools may require internet connection for full functionality
- Results should be interpreted within simulation context

**Known Issues:**
- Guardian v4 integration requires local installation
- Some features may have limited browser compatibility
- Performance may vary with document length

---

## Data & Privacy



**Study Design Notes:**
- Interactive demonstrations (not controlled studies)
- No preregistration required for software tools
- Deterministic behavior may vary by platform
- Results should be considered exploratory

**Data Handling:**
- All processing is designed to run locally (implementation-dependent) (no data sent to external servers)
- User data may not be stored by default (verify in source code) or tracked
- Document content remains on user's machine

**Citations:**
- Universal Resilience Law: See project documentation
- Guardian v4 methodology: HYMetaLab (2025)

## Support & Community

**Documentation:** See README and inline comments  
**Issues:** Report bugs via GitHub Issues (if applicable)  
**Updates:** Follow project repository for updates

**Contributing:**
- Bug reports welcome
- Feature requests considered
- Pull requests reviewed
