# Phase 33 — Cooperative Meaning Fields (CMF)

**Status:** ✅ Preregistered  
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 🎯 Research Question

Do Trust + Meaning field interactions maintain consciousness stability (ΔCCI ≥ 0.03) and may reduce system hazard (≥0.01) within optimal coupling parameters?

---

## 📋 Hypothesis

**H1:** Within ε ∈ [0.0005, 0.0015], systems near ρ★ ≈ 0.0828 with positive Trust/Meaning deltas sustain ΔCCI ≥ 0.03 and may reduce hazard ≥ 0.01 vs. control.

### Rationale
Based on Meaning Periodic Table v0.2, trust-meaning coupling should:
1. Stabilize consciousness calibration index (CCI)
2. may Reduce system hazard through cooperative dynamics
3. Show strongest effects near critical density ρ★ ≈ 0.0828

---

## 🔧 Experimental Design

### Parameters

**Fixed Constants:**
- Seeds: [11, 17, 23] (deterministic, preregistered)
- Agents: 200
- Noise: 0.05
- Shock: epoch 1000, severity 0.50
- Analysis window: [960, 1040] epochs

**Parameter Sweep:**
- **ε (epsilon):** [0.0005, 0.0010, 0.0015] - coupling strength
- **ρ (rho):** [0.06, 0.0828, 0.10] - density parameter
- **Δtrust:** [0.00, 0.04, 0.06] - trust interaction delta
- **Δmeaning:** [0.00, 0.03, 0.05] - meaning field delta

**Total runs:** 243 (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3)

## 📊 Primary Outcomes

### Required Exports
All runs must export:
- `CCI` - Consciousness Calibration Index
- `hazard` - System hazard level
- `risk` - Calculated risk metric
- `survival` - Agent survival rate
- `seed` - Random seed used
- `epoch` - Time point

### Success Criteria

**Metric 1: CCI Gain**
- Measure: mean(ΔCCI) across conditions
- Threshold: ≥ 0.03
- Rationale: Meaningful consciousness stability may increase

**Metric 2: Hazard Reduction**
- Measure: mean(Δhazard) across conditions
- Threshold: ≤ -0.01
- Rationale: Reduced system risk

### Classification

**Validated:**
- stability_CCI_mean ≥ 0.50
- stability_hazard_mean ≤ 0.20
- stability_CCI_slope ≥ 0.0005

**Under Review:**
- All other outcomes

---

## 🔬 Validation

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
- Iterations: 800
- Method: Percentile bootstrap
- Confidence level: 95%

### Statistical Tests
1. Main effect of epsilon on CCI
2. Main effect of trust_delta on hazard
3. Main effect of meaning_delta on survival
4. Interaction: (trust_delta × meaning_delta) → CCI
5. Density dependence: effect size vs. (ρ - 0.0828)
