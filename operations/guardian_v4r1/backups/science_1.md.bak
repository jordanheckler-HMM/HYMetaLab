# Quantum Coherence in Biological Systems

## Abstract

This study measured quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes using ultrafast spectroscopy (n=150, λ=680nm). The experimental data demonstrates significant coherence lifetimes (t=660±40 fs, p<0.001) as shown in Figure 1.

## Methodology

Laboratory protocols followed standard procedures for sample preparation (Smith et al. 2020). Control variables included temperature (T=77K), laser intensity, and measurement timing (Jones & Brown 2019, doi.org/10.1234/quantum).

## Results

Statistical analysis reveals strong correlations between coherence and energy transfer efficiency (r=0.82, 95% CI [0.78, 0.86], p<0.001). The data shows that quantum effects persist longer than predicted by classical models (Garcia et al. 2021).

Observed phenomena replicate earlier findings (Lee 2020, https://example.com/quantum-bio) with improved precision. Measurements indicate coherent superposition states (Martinez & Chen 2022, arxiv.org/abs/2201.12345).
