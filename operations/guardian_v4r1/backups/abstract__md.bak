# Abstract



*Note: Findings are within simulation context, simulation-validated, hypothesis requiring empirical testing.*


## Methods
Briefly state datasets, parameters, seeds, and procedures.

## Limitations
List key caveats (sampling bias, small N, model assumptions).

## Evidence & Links
- [Link 1](#)
- [Link 2](#)

Epistemic boundary: Results are contingent on dataset scope, fixed seeds, and current model versions; claims are provisional and subject to replication.
