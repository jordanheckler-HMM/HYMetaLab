   - Abstract must include: "within simulation context"
   - Use: "suggests / indicates / supports the hypothesis"

 **Avoid (auto-flag):**
-- Strong: "proves", "confirms", "definitive", "conclusive"
+- Strong: "suggests", "confirms", "definitive", "conclusive"
 - Universal: "universal law", "applies to all systems"
