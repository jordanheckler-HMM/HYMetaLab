 ## 🎯 Research Question
 
-Do Trust + Meaning field interactions maintain consciousness stability (ΔCCI ≥ 0.03) and reduce system hazard (≥0.01) within optimal coupling parameters?
+Do Trust + Meaning field interactions maintain consciousness stability (ΔCCI ≥ 0.03) and may reduce system hazard (≥0.01) within optimal coupling parameters?

 ## 📋 Hypothesis
 
-**H1:** Within ε ∈ [0.0005, 0.0015], systems near ρ★ ≈ 0.0828 with positive Trust/Meaning deltas sustain ΔCCI ≥ 0.03 and reduce hazard ≥ 0.01 vs. control.

 ### Rationale
 Based on Meaning Periodic Table v0.2, trust-meaning coupling should:
 1. Stabilize consciousness calibration index (CCI)
-2. Reduce system hazard through cooperative dynamics
+2. may Reduce system hazard through cooperative dynamics
 3. Show strongest effects near critical density ρ★ ≈ 0.0828
