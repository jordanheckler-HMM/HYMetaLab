 # Cognitive Load and Decision Quality
 
 ## Introduction

 ## Experimental Design
 
-Research demonstrates that task complexity increases cognitive load (Miller et al. 2020, doi.org/10.5678/cognitive). Evidence suggests that training reduces this effect (Thompson 2019, Figure 2).

 The findings show clear patterns across conditions (Peterson 2021, arxiv.org/abs/2104.56789). Data supports the theoretical framework (Kumar et al. 2020).
