 *Note: Findings are within simulation context, simulation-validated, hypothesis requiring empirical testing.*
+
+
+## Methods
+Briefly state datasets, parameters, seeds, and procedures.
+
+## Limitations
+List key caveats (sampling bias, small N, model assumptions).
+
+## Evidence & Links

+
+Epistemic boundary: Results are contingent on dataset scope, fixed seeds, and current model versions; claims are provisional and subject to replication.
