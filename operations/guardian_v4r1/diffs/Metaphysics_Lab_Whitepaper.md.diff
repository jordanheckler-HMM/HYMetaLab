 - Consciousness Capacity Law: systems with higher CCI have greater capacity to resist collapse under matched shock energy.
-- Openness–Survival Law: small, sustained energy inflow ε increases survival probability in finite collectives, with diminishing returns above optimal bands.
+- Openness–Survival Law: small, sustained energy inflow ε may increases survival probability in finite collectives, with diminishing returns above optimal bands.
 - Observer–Coherence Law: observation density ρ has a non‑monotonic effect on collective coherence; there exists a critical density ρ★ maximizing ΔCCI.
 - Energy–Information Equivalence Law: energy inflow and informational coupling display equivalent elasticity in supporting survival (measured elasticity ≈ 1 in our experiments).

 - Small, controlled openness (ε ≈ 0.001) provides a stabilizing inflow of resources that supports recovery following acute shocks.
 - Energy and information act as dual stabilizers: their elasticities are approximately equal, suggesting an operational equivalence for resilience.
 
-These findings align with intuition from socio‑technical systems (limited but sufficient connectivity aids coordination), thermodynamics (small sustained energy inputs stabilize non‑equilibrium steady states), and information theory (observation can both reduce uncertainty and inject volatility).
