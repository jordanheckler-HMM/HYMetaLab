 # Phase 4 Open-Source Data Integration: A Simulation-Bounded Investigation
 
 **Authors:** HYMetaLab Research Team

 **Methods:** Five open-source datasets (social capital, well-being, trust networks, collaboration patterns, education outcomes) were standardized and validated through a multi-stage pipeline: Guardian v4 (ethics), TruthLens (truth index), MeaningForge (semantics), and OriginChain (hypothesis synthesis). The framework employs the Collective Coherence Index (CCI), a simulation-bounded metric of internal coherence.
 
-**Results:** All datasets achieved perfect validation scores (TruthLens: 1.000, MeaningForge: 1.000). The synthesis narrative achieved Guardian v4 score of 87.0/100 (Objectivity: 86.2, Transparency: 93.5, Sentiment: 90.3), indicating strong ethical alignment and reproducibility standards. Five novel hypotheses were generated, with 20 testable predictions emerging from the integrated analysis.
