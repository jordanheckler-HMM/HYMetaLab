-Data analysis shows significant increases in spine density following stimulation (Δ=2.3±0.4 spines/μm, p<0.001, Figure 2). The results indicate that molecular mechanisms drive structural changes (Anderson & Liu 2022).
+Data analysis shows significant may increases in spine density following stimulation (Δ=2.3±0.4 spines/μm, p<0.001, Figure 2). The results indicate that molecular mechanisms drive structural changes (Anderson & Liu 2022).
 
 Statistical models reveal dose-dependent responses (F(3,196)=45.2, p<0.001) consistent with theoretical predictions (Kumar 2019, https://example.com/plasticity). Observed effects replicate across multiple brain regions (Davis et al. 2021, Table 1).
