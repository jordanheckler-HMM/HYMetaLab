# Epistemic Boundary Integration Log

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Task:** Integrate epistemic boundary utilities into Guardian Check App  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Successfully integrated epistemic boundary declarations and hedging utilities into the Guardian Check application, ensuring all user-facing messages maintain intellectual humility and Guardian alignment.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `tools/epistemic.py` (Created)
**SHA256:** `d78264beb2dada8d0afbb966931ff3c6304f6e162146f37e0dfdedf0be007c10`

**Purpose:** Centralized epistemic boundary utilities for HYMetaLab

**Contents:**
- `BOUNDARY` constant — Standard epistemic boundary declaration
- `hedge(s)` — Add epistemic hedging to claims
- `boundary_header()` — Format boundary for reports
- `wrap_claim(claim, confidence)` — Confidence-based hedging
- `add_boundary_to_report(report)` — Prepend boundary to reports
- `EPISTEMIC_MARKERS` dict — 7 epistemic markers with explanations
- `get_marker_explanation(marker)` — Explain epistemic markers

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Ruff linting: All checks passed
- ✅ Black formatting: Applied (PEP 8 compliant)
- ✅ Import test: Module loads successfully
- ✅ Function tests: All utilities working

### 2. `apps/guardian_check_app.py` (Modified)
**SHA256:** `d0aa2d9b023c640ef62aa00048b88de83638d2d7284a83919bdf1515d01d5922`

**Changes Applied:**

#### a. Added Module Docstring + Epistemic Boundary
```python
"""
Guardian Check Application

Real-time ethical alignment validation for research documents.
Provides interactive interface for Guardian v4 validation.
"""

from tools.epistemic import BOUNDARY, hedge

# Add epistemic boundary to module documentation
__doc__ = (__doc__ or "") + "\n\n" + BOUNDARY
```

#### b. Hedged "About Guardian" Sidebar Info
```python
guardian_info = hedge(
    "Guardian v4 validates documents against: Objectivity (hedge terms, claims, citations), "
    "Sentiment (neutrality and balance), Transparency (metadata, reproducibility), "
    "and Safety (risk assessment). Target: ≥90/100 for publication."
)
st.sidebar.info(guardian_info)
```

#### c. Hedged Result Messages
All score result messages now use `hedge()` to maintain epistemic humility:

```python
# Example: Excellent score
msg = hedge(f"Guardian score of {score:.1f}/100 indicates strong alignment with integrity standards.")
st.success(f"✅ **Guardian Score: {score:.1f}/100** (Excellent)\n\n{msg}")
```

Applied to all 4 score ranges:
- ≥90: "indicates strong alignment"
- ≥80: "indicates good alignment"
- ≥70: "indicates acceptable alignment, though review is recommended"
- <70: "indicates improvements may enhance integrity alignment"

#### d. Added Epistemic Boundary Footer
```python
with st.expander("ℹ️ Epistemic Boundary"):
    st.info(BOUNDARY)
    st.caption(
        "Guardian scores are indicative assessments based on current heuristics and "
        "should be interpreted as one signal among many in evaluating document quality."
    )
```

**Quality Checks:**
- ✅ Ruff linting: All checks passed (E402 suppressed for Streamlit requirement)
- ✅ Black formatting: Applied (PEP 8 compliant)
- ✅ Import test: Module imports work correctly

---

## Compliance

✅ **SOP v1.1** — Epistemic boundaries documented and enforced  
✅ **Institutional Charter v2.0** — Intellectual humility maintained  
✅ **Guardian Alignment** — All user-facing claims hedged appropriately  
✅ **Integrity Standards** — SHA256 checksums computed and logged

---

## Impact

### Before Integration
- Guardian Check app presented results without epistemic qualifiers
- No standardized hedging mechanism
- User-facing messages stated findings as facts

### After Integration
- All results include epistemic hedging
- Standardized `BOUNDARY` declaration available
- User-facing messages appropriately qualified
- Expandable epistemic boundary explanation in footer
- Centralized utilities available for other modules

---

## Usage Examples

### In the Guardian Check App

**Sidebar Info (hedged):**
> "Guardian v4 validates documents against: Objectivity (hedge terms, claims, citations), Sentiment (neutrality and balance), Transparency (metadata, reproducibility), and Safety (risk assessment). Target: ≥90/100 for publication. This suggests, but does not prove, the effect; alternative explanations may exist."

**Excellent Score Result (hedged):**
> "Guardian score of 92.5/100 indicates strong alignment with integrity standards. This suggests, but does not prove, the effect; alternative explanations may exist."

**Epistemic Boundary Footer:**
> "Epistemic boundary: Results are contingent on dataset scope, fixed seeds, and current model versions; claims should be read as provisional and subject to replication."

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. **Integrate into other apps:**
   - `apps/loop_lite_core.py`
   - Any dashboard or reporting tools

2. **Use in validation reports:**
   ```python
   from tools.epistemic import add_boundary_to_report
   
   report = generate_validation_report()
   final_report = add_boundary_to_report(report)
   ```

3. **Use in research outputs:**
   ```python
   from tools.epistemic import wrap_claim
   
   claim = "X causes Y"
   hedged = wrap_claim(claim, confidence='moderate')
   ```

4. **Add to Guardian validation checks:**
   - Check for presence of epistemic markers in documents
   - Reward usage of `EPISTEMIC_MARKERS` terms
