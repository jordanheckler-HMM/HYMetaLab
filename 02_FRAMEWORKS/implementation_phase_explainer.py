implementation_phase_explainer.py

This module was archived because it contained speculative, non-empirical claims
that are not appropriate for a reproducible scientific codebase. The original
file has been preserved in the archive: ARCHIVE_NON_SCIENTIFIC/implementation_phase_explainer.py.orig

This file is a safe stub. It prevents accidental execution of archived logic.
To reintroduce functionality, review the archived original, refactor to remove
unverifiable claims, add tests and provenance, and implement a testable API.
