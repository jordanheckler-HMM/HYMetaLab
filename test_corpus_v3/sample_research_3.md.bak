# Network Resilience and Adaptation

## Background

Evidence indicates that network structure affects resilience (Roberts & Green 2022). The study found significant differences between topologies (p<0.001, η²=0.34) as demonstrated in Figure 1.

## Analysis

Results show that adaptation mechanisms improve outcomes (Wang et al. 2021, doi.org/10.9012/networks). Data suggests rapid recovery in clustered networks (mean=2.3 days, SD=0.5) per Johnson 2020.

## Implications

Research demonstrates that redundancy enhances robustness (Taylor & Smith 2023, https://example.com/redundancy). Analysis reveals optimal strategies (Martinez 2021, Table 3).

The findings indicate strong practical applications (Harrison et al. 2020, arxiv.org/abs/2105.98765).
