# HYMetaLab Terminology Map — CRA Directive 2025-10-15

**Lab Tech:** Research Ops  
**Created:** 2025-10-15  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

---

## Purpose

This document provides a human-readable mapping of legacy terminology to CRA-approved (Compliance Review & Alignment) replacements. All changes reflect epistemic humility, scientific accuracy, and OpenLaws §3.4 compliance.

**Directive:** CRA 2025-10-15  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Scope:** All HYMetaLab documentation, code, dashboards, and publications

## Terminology Map

| Legacy Term | Replacement | Context | Date Applied | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Consciousness Calibration Index** | **Collective Coherence Index (CCI)** | All metrics, dashboards, papers | 2025-10-15 | Reduces overclaim risk; CCI is simulation-bounded internal coherence metric, not a consciousness measure |
| **Mathematical Metaphysics** | **Quantitative Simulation Framework for Collective Coherence** | Framework descriptions, methodology | 2025-10-15 | Clarifies computational/simulation nature; removes metaphysical implications |
| **Energy-Information Equivalence** | **Energy-Information Complementarity** | Theoretical basis, model assumptions | 2025-10-15 | Softens deterministic claim; "complementarity" suggests relationship without strict equivalence |
| **η→0 (law)** | **η→0 (hypothesis)** | Universal Resilience framework, equations | 2025-10-15 | Downgrades from "law" to "hypothesis" pending multi-study validation (N≥10 seeds required) |
| **CCI (unqualified)** | **CCI (simulation-bounded)** | All metric references | 2025-10-15 | Explicit scope qualifier prevents misinterpretation as universal metric |
| **Proves / Demonstrates (causal)** | **Suggests / May indicate / Consistent with** | All findings, results sections | 2025-10-15 | Hedging language for simulation-scoped claims (OpenLaws §3.4) |
| **Consciousness proxy** | **Coherence proxy** | Model descriptions, variable names | 2025-10-15 | Removes consciousness claim; focuses on measurable coherence |
| **Universal law** | **Simulation-scoped pattern / hypothesis** | Claims about findings | 2025-10-15 | Epistemic boundary compliance; no universal claims from simulations |
| **Validated (N<10)** | **Hypothesis-generating / Preliminary** | Classification labels | 2025-10-15 | Reserves "validated" for N≥10 seeds with bootstrap CI |
| **Establishes causality** | **Associated with / Correlated with** | Statistical findings | 2025-10-15 | Prevents causal overclaiming from correlational simulation data |

## Deprecated Terms (Do Not Use)

The following terms are **deprecated** and should be replaced immediately in all new work:

❌ **Consciousness Calibration Index**  
❌ **Mathematical Metaphysics**  
❌ **Energy-Information Equivalence**  
❌ **η→0 (law)**  
❌ **Proves** (in simulation context)  
❌ **Demonstrates** (causal claims)  
❌ **Confirms** (theory validation)  
❌ **Universal law** (from simulation)  
❌ **Consciousness metric**  
❌ **Establishes causality**

---

## Approved Terms (Current Standard)

The following terms are **approved** for use in all documentation:

✅ **Collective Coherence Index (CCI)** — with "simulation-bounded" qualifier  
✅ **Quantitative Simulation Framework for Collective Coherence**  
✅ **Energy-Information Complementarity**  
✅ **η→0 (hypothesis)**  
✅ **Suggests** / **May indicate** / **Consistent with** (hedging)  
✅ **Coherence proxy**  
✅ **Simulation-scoped pattern**  
✅ **Hypothesis-generating** (for N<10)  
✅ **Associated with** / **Correlated with** (statistics)  
✅ **Internal coherence metric**

---

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Scope Qualifiers (Required)

Always include scope qualifiers when discussing CCI or findings:

**Example:**
- ✅ "CCI (simulation-bounded) suggests..."
- ❌ "CCI proves..."

**Example:**
- ✅ "Within this simulation framework, patterns suggest..."
- ❌ "This establishes a universal law..."

### 2. Hedging Language (Required)

Use appropriate hedging for all simulation-derived claims:

**Acceptable Hedges:**
- "suggests"
- "may indicate"
- "appears consistent with"
- "preliminary findings show"
- "hypothesis-generating analysis reveals"
- "within simulation parameters"

**Avoid:**
- "proves"
- "demonstrates definitively"
- "confirms"
- "establishes"
- "validates universally"

### 3. Classification Thresholds

**Hypothesis-Generating:**
- N < 10 seeds
- No bootstrap CI
- Exploratory analysis
- Use term: "hypothesis-generating" or "preliminary"

**Validated:**
- N ≥ 10 seeds
- Bootstrap CI (n=1000)
- Guardian v4 ≥ 70
- Preregistered
- Use term: "validated" with qualifiers

### 4. Epistemic Boundary (OpenLaws §3.4)

All documents must include:

> **Epistemic Boundary (OpenLaws §3.4):** Findings describe simulation-bounded behaviors within controlled model scope and do not imply universal physical laws.

**Placement:**
- Abstracts (required)
- Methods section (required)
- Discussion/Limitations (required)
- Data availability statement (recommended)
