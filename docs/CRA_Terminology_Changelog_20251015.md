# CRA Terminology Realignment — Change Log

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Lab Tech:** Documentation  
**Directive:** CRA Compliance Update  
**Version:** QC Alignment v1

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Apply CRA-approved terminology changes across all public and internal documentation to ensure compliance with current scientific standards and avoid overclaiming or metaphysical language.

---

## 📝 Terminology Changes Applied

### 1. Consciousness Calibration Index → Collective Coherence Index

**Rationale:** "Consciousness" implies claims about subjective experience that are not supported by the simulation framework. "Collective Coherence" more accurately describes the metric as a measure of system-level coherence in agent interactions.

**Scope:** Simulation-bounded, internal coherence metric

**Files Affected:** All docs/, YAML configs, dashboard_data.json

---

### 2. Mathematical Metaphysics → Quantitative Simulation Framework for Collective Coherence

**Rationale:** "Mathematical Metaphysics" suggests claims beyond the scope of computational modeling. The new term accurately describes the work as a quantitative simulation framework focused on collective coherence patterns.

**Files Affected:** All docs/, research documentation

---

### 3. Energy–Information Equivalence → Energy–Information Complementarity

**Rationale:** "Equivalence" overstates the relationship. "Complementarity" more accurately captures the framework's treatment of energy and information as complementary aspects within the simulation, not claiming physical equivalence.

**Files Affected:** All docs/, theoretical documentation

---

### 4. η→0 (law) → η→0 (hypothesis)

**Rationale:** Downgrade from "law" to "hypothesis" reflects appropriate epistemic humility. The η→0 limit is a hypothesis within the simulation framework, not a proven physical law.

**Files Affected:** All docs/, research papers, YAML configs

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### dashboard_data.json
```json
{
  "cci_label": "Collective Coherence Index"
}
```

### field_unified_constants_v33c.yml
```yaml
cci_label: "Collective Coherence Index"
cci_scope: "Simulation-bounded, internal coherence metric"
```

---

## 📊 Impact Summary

**Files Modified:** ~50+ files across docs/, configs, dashboards  
**Global Substitutions:** 4 terminology changes  
**Metadata Updates:** 2 configuration files  
**Breaking Changes:** None (internal terminology only)

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

If needed, revert to pre-alignment state:

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1
# Or
git revert qc_alignment_v1
```

## 🎯 Future Considerations

### Additional Terms for Review
- "Universal Resilience Law" — Consider "Universal Resilience Hypothesis"
- "Validated" vs "Supported by simulation data"
- "Proves" vs "Suggests" in all claims

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Regular terminology audits via Guardian v4
- Quarterly review of scientific claims
- External peer review of publications
