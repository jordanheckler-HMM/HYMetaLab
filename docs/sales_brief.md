One-page sales brief â€” Consciousness Proxy Simulation

Target buyer: Research labs, biotech (lab pipeline/histology), computational physics groups

What this is
- A turnkey collection of modular simulation experiments and analysis scripts that reproduce and extend demos across: lab/workflow simulation, belief/meaning emergent tests, and physics N-body sweeps.

Key buyer outcomes
- Rapid prototyping: run demo experiments immediately and reproduce analytical figures for proposals or publications.
- Reduced engineering time: fully working sweeps, plotting, and per-run provenance reduce months of lift.
- Decision support: lab-pipeline and histology demos simulate throughput and QC tradeoffs.

Included deliverables
- Reproducible experiments and run manifests
- Sweep drivers and aggregated JSON/CSV summaries
- Energy conservation & binding diagnostics for N-body physics
- Example reports and PNG/PDF summaries (generated by analysis scripts)

Pilot offering (example)
- 4-week pilot ($45k): adapt one experiment to buyer data, run parameter sweeps, present results and a one-page ROI/summary.

Why now
- The repo has working demos and outputs; a small polish + pilot converts this into actionable, decision-ready results for operations or research.

Contact & next steps
- Run `python3 bin/run_demo.py kepler-demo` to see the Kepler demo.
- Contact for a tailored pilot or engineering engagement.
