# Equation Refinement Report (v1)

Rows read: 224, dropped missing required: 0, dropped invalid logs: 0

## Noise Ceiling
- Estimated upper R² bound (due to seed noise): **0.9999992599728544**

## Model Fit Summary
- **M0**: R²=0.040, adjR²=-0.002, n=48
- **M1**: R²=NA, adjR²=NA, n=0
- **M2**: R²=NA, adjR²=NA, n=0

### Regime Split (M3)
- closed: insufficient data (n=0)
- min_open: insufficient data (n=0)
- open: insufficient data (n=0)

## Recommendation
Prefer M2 (interactions) unless regime splits show significantly better fits; consider piecewise by openness regime.
