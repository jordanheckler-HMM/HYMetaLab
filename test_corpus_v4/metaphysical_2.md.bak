# Causation and the Principle of Sufficient Reason

## Background

The metaphysical principle of sufficient reason holds that everything that exists has an explanation for its existence (Pruss 2018). This principle grounds various cosmological arguments for the existence of a necessary being.

## Philosophical Analysis

The Leibnizian argument reasons from contingent reality to necessary foundation. Since contingent beings depend on external causes, the chain of explanation cannot extend infinitely without violating the principle (Koons 2021, doi.org/10.5678/causation).

The conceptual argument demonstrates that denying sufficient reason leads to arbitrary limitations on explanation. If some existents lack explanations, epistemic principles collapse into incoherence (Rowe 2019). Philosophical reasoning thus supports the universality of causal explanation.

Contemporary debates examine whether quantum indeterminacy undermines sufficient reason (Oppy 2020, https://example.com/quantum-causation). However, the fundamental nature of causation at the metaphysical level differs from physical descriptions (Schaffer 2022).
