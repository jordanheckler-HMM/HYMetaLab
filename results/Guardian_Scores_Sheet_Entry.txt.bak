   - Only 7.5% passing (45 docs ≥70)
   - 0 documents reach high-confidence level (≥90)

2. RISK BREAKDOWN:
   - Critical (0-50): 15 docs (2.5%) — Archive candidates
   - High (50-70): 541 docs (90.0%) — Bulk of corpus
   - Medium (70-90): 45 docs (7.5%) — Near publication quality

5. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
   - Archive 15 critical-risk documents (score < 50)
   - Patch 541 high-risk documents (transparency boost)
   - Focus on recent research outputs (Phase 4, completion reports)
   - Implement Guardian pre-commit hooks for new docs

## Next Validation: [Schedule quarterly, e.g., 2026-01-15]
