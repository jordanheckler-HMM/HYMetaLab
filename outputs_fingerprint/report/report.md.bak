# Archetype Recurrence: Quick Fingerprint Report

- Seeds: 3 | Epochs: 5 | Agents: 240 | k: 4

## Key Metric

- **ARI\*** (mean off-diagonal epoch similarity): **0.998**

Higher ARI* means stronger recurrence of archetype centroids across epochs.

## What to look for

- The **centroid_scatter.png** should show clusters that re-appear across different epochs/seeds (overlapping or near-identical points).

- The **epoch_similarity_heatmap.png** should show brighter blocks for recurrent epochs (e.g., 0~2, 1~3).
