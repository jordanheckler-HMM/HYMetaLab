# Abstract

*Note: Findings are within simulation context, simulation-validated, hypothesis requiring empirical testing.*

## Methods
Briefly state datasets, parameters, seeds, and procedures.

## Limitations
List relevant caveats (sampling bias, small N, model assumptions).

## Evidence & Links

Epistemic boundary: Results are contingent on dataset scope, fixed seeds, and current model versions; claims are provisional and subject to replication.

## Data Provenance
- **Source:** HYMetaLab simulation framework (v1.0)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/hymetalab/consciousness_proxy_sim
- **Validation:** Guardian v4, TruthLens v1, MeaningForge v3
- **Reproducibility:** Seeds fixed, parameters documented in `config.yaml`
