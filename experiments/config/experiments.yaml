  - id: telescope_vs_oracle
    hypothesis: >
      Telescope-mode (iterative, fact-check) yields higher shock_tolerance and lower collapse_risk than oracle-mode for equivalent base CCI.

  - id: shock_dose_response
    hypothesis: >
      An optimal constructive shock band exists; below it growth is slow, above it collapse risk rises.

  - id: collective_amplification

      Networked agents (peer feedback) show higher collective_cci_delta than isolated agents.

  - id: meaning_vs_training_branch
    hypothesis: >
      Severe shocks favor “meaning/religion” branching; chronic stress favors “education/training”.

  - id: noise_manipulation

      Lowering noise via practice increases survival_rate and shock_tolerance nonlinearly.
