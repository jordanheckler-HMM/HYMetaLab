    hypothesis: >
      Telescope-mode (iterative, fact-check) yields higher shock_tolerance and lower collapse_risk than oracle-mode for equivalent base CCI.

  - id: shock_dose_response
    hypothesis: >
      There is an optimal constructive shock band; below it growth is slow, above it collapse risk rises.
