# HYMetaLab Scientific Language Policy
**Version 1.0** | **Effective: 2025-10-14**

## Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for epistemic humility, transparency, and scientific rigor in all HYMetaLab communications, reports, and publications.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge the limitations of computational simulations
2. **Transparency**: Explicitly state assumptions, parameters, and validation status
3. **Reproducibility**: Provide sufficient detail for independent replication
4. **Appropriate Hedging**: Use conditional language for preliminary findings

---

## Language Guidelines

### ✅ PREFERRED Terms

| Context | Preferred Language |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Findings** | "suggests", "is consistent with", "supports the hypothesis that" |
| **Evidence** | "provides preliminary evidence for", "warrants further investigation" |
| **Causality** | "suggests a causal relationship", "may causally contribute to" |
| **Scope** | "within this simulation", "under these conditions", "in this model" |
| **Status** | "preliminary findings", "hypothesis-generating results" |
| **Effects** | "appears to increase", "shows a trend toward", "is associated with" |

### ❌ AVOID Terms (Without Qualification)

| Term | Issue | Acceptable Qualified Form |
|------|-------|---------------------------|
| "proves" | Overconfident | "provides strong evidence that..." |
| "confirms" | Too definitive | "is consistent with..." |
| "demonstrates" | Overclaiming | "suggests..." |
| "establishes" | Too strong | "supports the hypothesis that..." |
| "definitive" | Inappropriate for simulations | "preliminary" |
| "conclusive" | Premature | "suggestive" |
| "universal law" | Unvalidated | "regularity within simulation" |
| "guarantees" | Inappropriate | "is expected to..." |

---

## Required Qualifications

### 1. All Causal Claims

**Format**: `[Finding] suggests a causal relationship (Δ[metric] = X, 95% CI [Y, Z])`

**Example**:
- ❌ "Openness increases coherence."
- ✅ "Openness (ε) appears to increase coherence (ΔCCI = +0.085, 95% CI [0.071, 0.099]), suggesting a causal relationship within this simulation framework."

### 2. All Effect Sizes

**Format**: Report point estimate + confidence interval

**Example**:
- ❌ "CCI improved."
- ✅ "CCI increased from baseline (mean Δ = +0.12, 95% CI [0.09, 0.15])."

### 3. All Novel Patterns

**Format**: Acknowledge need for validation

**Example**:
- ❌ "We discovered a new law of consciousness."
- ✅ "The simulation exhibits a regularity (R ∝ ε×CCI/η) that warrants empirical investigation. Classification: HYPOTHESIS-GEN."

### 4. All Comparisons to Reality

**Format**: Explicitly note simulation context

**Example**:
- ❌ "Human societies behave this way."
- ✅ "Within simulation, agent societies exhibit behavior *consistent with* observed human patterns (e.g., Dunbar's number). Independent validation required."

---

## Classification System

All findings must be tagged with validation status:

| Status | Definition | Language Restrictions |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **VALIDATED** | Meets preregistered thresholds; bootstrap CI confirms | May use "robust finding", "validated result" |
| **UNDER_REVIEW** | Partial validation; promising but incomplete | Must use "preliminary", "requires further validation" |
| **HYPOTHESIS-GEN** | Exploratory; pattern detected but not validated | Must use "exploratory finding", "hypothesis for testing" |

---

## Examples

### ✅ GOOD: Appropriately Hedged Report

```markdown
# Phase 33b: Cooperative Meaning Emergence

---
**Research Context**: Computational simulation (HYMetaLab OpenLaws)  
**Status**: Preliminary / Hypothesis-generating  
**Classification**: UNDER_REVIEW
---

## Findings

Cooperative meaning contexts suggest an increase in collective coherence 
(mean ΔCCI = +0.078, 95% CI [0.061, 0.095]) relative to competitive baselines. 
This pattern is consistent with theories of shared intentionality (Tomasello et al., 2005) 
and warrants empirical validation in human groups.

Within this simulation framework, agents exposed to cooperative framing exhibited 
lower hazard rates (Δhazard = -0.023, 95% CI [-0.031, -0.015]), suggesting that 
meaning-alignment may causally contribute to resilience under the Universal Resilience 
Law (R ∝ ε×CCI/η).

**Limitations**: Results are derived from agent-based models with simplified social 
dynamics. Real-world cooperation involves cognitive, cultural, and institutional factors 
not captured in this simulation. Independent empirical studies required.

**Data**: `discovery_results/phase33b_coop_meaning_20251014_001935/`  
**Preregistration**: `studies/phase33b_coop_meaning.yml` | Seeds: [11, 17]
```

### ❌ BAD: Overclaimed Report

```markdown
# Phase 33b: Cooperative Meaning Emergence

## Findings

Cooperative meaning **proves** that shared contexts **definitively increase** coherence. 
Our simulation **confirms the universal law** that cooperation is the **only path** to 
collective resilience.

This **establishes** that human societies **must** adopt cooperative frameworks to survive.
```

**Issues**:
- "proves", "definitively", "confirms the universal law", "only path", "must" — all overclaiming
- No simulation context stated
- No confidence intervals
- No limitations acknowledged
- No citations
- Inappropriate generalization to human societies without qualification

---

## Enforcement

1. **Guardian v3.0**: Automated scanning for language violations
   - Minimum alignment score: 70/100
   - CI/CD integration blocks merges below threshold

2. **Peer Review**: All VALIDATED studies require co-author sign-off on language policy compliance

3. **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Markdown files checked for required disclaimer, classification, and hedging

4. **Training**: All research agents receive language policy orientation

---

## Rationale

**Why Epistemic Humility Matters**:
1. **Scientific Integrity**: Simulation results are hypothesis-generating, not empirical proof
2. **Reproducibility**: Overclaiming harms credibility and reproduction attempts
3. **Ethical Responsibility**: Overconfident claims can mislead stakeholders and policymakers
4. **Long-term Credibility**: Conservative language builds trust; overclaiming destroys it

**Why Computational Research Requires Extra Caution**:
- Simulations explore possibility space, not necessarily reality
- Parameter choices affect outcomes (sensitivity analysis required)
- Agent models simplify human complexity
- Validation against real-world data is non-negotiable for application

---

## Updates

This policy will be reviewed quarterly and updated based on:
- Guardian v3 alignment trends
- External review feedback
- Community standards evolution
- Empirical validation outcomes

**Version History**:
- v1.0 (2025-10-14): Initial release
